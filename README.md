I am a MSc Biostatistics student at University of Toronto. Currently, I am currently working on my practicum project, "Genome-wide genetic association analysis of quantitative traits with repeated measures" at the Bull Lab, Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute under Dr. Shelley Bull's supervision.
